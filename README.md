# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview of the project: 
Understand what unsupervised learning is used for, how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce your dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA. Create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for a new investment.
